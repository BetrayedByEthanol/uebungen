                <b>Cody Zech</b> was born on the 4th of December 1996, in Hellersdorf, Berlin at 6:30pm. Moving seemingly constantly in his first 4 years of life, 
                Cody's mother decided to move to a country named Ireland.<br>
                At the age of 19, Cody decided to move to Germany with his Sister's help. Once there he started an Apprenticeship as an Electronics Engineer. Through some
                unlucky circumstances, Cody had to break off the apprenticeship.
                Some time around May 2018, Cody took part in a Vocational Guidance course provided by the government. There he met some great friends, <i><b>Marcel ZÃ¶llner, Julius Behm and Laura Seifert</b></i>.
                They surprisingly held together through thick and thin, and managed to complete the "BF", all choosing to do an Apprenticeship as IT Specialists for Application Development.

                The first few months were rough to say the least. Groups were shuffled, days were left empty, but still, the apprenticeship was fun. Cody now learns how to code at work and in his spare
                time and it seems to suit him, though every now and then he does worry if he'll finish the apprenticeship, if he's good enough. But for now things are going pretty smoothly.
